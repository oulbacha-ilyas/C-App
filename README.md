This assignment is to use what I learned in the module "Advanced Software Engineering" to produce a fairly complex 
program. The idea of the program is to produce a simplified environment for teaching simple 
programming concepts. It is about creating a simple programming language and environment 
that has the basics of sequence, selection, and iteration and allows a student programmer to 
explore them using graphics. The app is created using c# and Windows Forms in the .Net Framework in visual studio. In the video attached, I explain the app's scope and its development process
